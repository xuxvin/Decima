Decima Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

Decima is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrencies.
- Anonymized transactions using zerocoin technology
- 100% Proof of Stake 3.0 Consensus protocol, allowing very low transaction fees and energy expenditure, and staking rewards to all participants in the network
- Masternode technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with collateral of 10K DIA

17.6M decima was produced for swapping. 500k were mined 1-200 blocks to bring that amount to 18.1M DIA, the amount needed for the swap.

_Unfortunately, the code was not originally properly forked on GitHub from the PIVX repository. This serves the same purpose. We forked from [PIVX-Project/PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/)._

Since then, the Decima repository has been rebaselined to show the fork relationship properly.
